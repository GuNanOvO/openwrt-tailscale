<details open>
<summary><h3>Important Notes</h3></summary>

> **⚠️ Requirements:**
> - **Storage Space**: Less than 10MB (UPX compressed)  
> - **Memory**: Approximately 60MB (runtime)  
> - **Network**: Access to GitHub  

> **⚠️ Important Considerations:**
> - May not work on devices with less than 256MB RAM  
> - Temporary installation heavily depends on network reliability! Recommended only for devices that cannot support persistent installation  
> - Most devices/architectures are untested. If you encounter issues, please submit an issue report

<summary><h3>Recommended Methods</h3></summary>

**One-Click Installation Script:**
> SSH into your OpenWrt device and execute:
> ```bash
> wget -O /usr/sbin/install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale/main/install_en.sh && chmod +x /usr/sbin/install.sh && /usr/sbin/install.sh
> ```

**Add opkg Repository:**
> See our repository branch [Feed Repository Branch](../feed/README.md) or visit our opkg repository page:  
> [Smaller Tailscale Repository For OpenWrt](https://gunanovo.github.io/openwrt-tailscale/)  
> Contains UPX-compressed ipk packages (mips64/mips64le available uncompressed only)

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Manual Installation</h3></summary>

#### Install ipk package:
 1. Download matching ipk package from [Releases](https://github.com/GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale/releases)  
 2. Install via OpenWrt web UI: System → Software → Upload Package  
> Note: Ignore "failed log upload" error when install if `tailscale up` works normally  

</details>

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter any of the following situations:
> > 1. Your device has limited RAM, and during usage, Tailscale consumes an excessive amount of memory;  
> > 2. Or Tailscale is killed and restarted by the OOM Killer;  
> > 3. Or you’re not sure why Tailscale keeps restarting unexpectedly;  
>
> Then you may try trading higher CPU usage for lower memory usage. Here's how:  
> > 1. Edit the `/etc/init.d/tailscale` file:
> >    ```bash
> >    vi /etc/init.d/tailscale  
> >    ```
> > 2. Locate the following line:
> >    ```bash
> >    procd_set_param env TS_DEBUG_FIREWALL_MODE="$fw_mode"  
> >    ```
> > 3. Append `GOGC=10` to the end of that line so it becomes:
> >    ```bash
> >    procd_set_param env TS_DEBUG_FIREWALL_MODE="$fw_mode" GOGC=10 
> >    ```
> >    This will make Tailscale more aggressive in memory garbage collection.

<summary><h2>Implementation Details</h2></summary>

#### Compilation Optimization:  
The following build parameters were used to slim down Tailscale:

```
ts_include_cli,ts_omit_aws,ts_omit_bird,ts_omit_completion,ts_omit_kube,ts_omit_systray,ts_omit_taildrop,ts_omit_tap,ts_omit_tpm,ts_omit_relayserver,ts_omit_capture,ts_omit_syspolicy,ts_omit_debugeventbus,ts_omit_webclient

LDFLAGS:
-s -w -buildid=
```

Additionally, by applying [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) binary compression, the Tailscale binary was reduced to only 20% of its original size, making it feasible to run Tailscale on OpenWrt devices with limited storage space 🎉.

#### Core Logic:  
1. **Persistent Installation**  
   - Places the `tailscaled` binary in `/usr/bin`, creating a symbolic link using `ln -sv tailscaled tailscale`. Only **6MB** of storage is required to run Tailscale.  

2. **Temporary Installation**  
   - Places the `tailscaled` binary in `/tmp`, creating a symbolic link as above. Since it is stored in the `/tmp` directory, this method **uses device RAM**. Upon reboot, the script will automatically re-download Tailscale.

## Self-Forking
If you need to fork this project, please note the following:

**Modify the install script**
 - Change all links pointing to `https://github.com/GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale/` to your forked repository URL.

**Modify GitHub Actions workflow files**
 - Update `.github/workflows/build-tailscale.yml` and `.github/workflows/check-version.yml` by replacing all instances of `GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale` with your forked project name. Usually, you only need to modify the env section.
 - `secrets.USIGN_SECRET_KEY_B64`: A private key generated using usign for signing ipk packages. Encode the private key with base64 and set it in your repository settings > security > secrets and variables > actions > Repository secrets.
 - `secrets.PAT_TOKEN`: A GitHub account `repo` permission token used by `.github/workflows/check-version.yml` to trigger `.github/workflows/build-tailscale.yml` for builds.
 - `secrets.GHCR_READ_TOKEN`: A GitHub account `read:packages` permission token used by actions to detect upstream ghcr releases. GHCR versions are not used by default and can be removed.

## Security Statement
This repository redistributes the official **Tailscale** open-source software, with the primary goal of providing timely updates for **OpenWrt** users, as a replacement for the outdated versions often found in community feeds.
Outdated versions of Tailscale may contain known vulnerabilities, and keeping Tailscale up-to-date is essential for maintaining network security.

**Transparency & Verifiability**  
 - **Open Source Code**: All build, packaging, and installation scripts are fully open-source. Anyone can inspect, audit, and reproduce the entire build and installation process.  
 - **Automated Builds**: All builds and packaging are executed via GitHub Actions. The build logs and artifacts are publicly accessible to ensure full transparency and no manual interference.  
 - **Built from Official Source**: All binaries are compiled directly from the Tailscale official repository’s released source code, with no functional modifications or hidden code.  
 - **Reproducible Builds**: Anyone can rebuild the same packages using the provided scripts either on GitHub or in a local environment to verify consistency and authenticity. 
  
**Security Commitment**  
 - This repository **does not introduce any malicious code**, nor does it collect or transmit any user data.
 - Only build-time optimizations are applied (such as binary size reduction); the core functionality and security model of Tailscale remain untouched.
 - All published packages include publicly verifiable build records and integrity data (SHA256 checksums / usign signatures).

Through these practices, this project aims to offer a **secure, transparent, and auditable** Tailscale installation and update path for OpenWrt users — reducing the risks associated with outdated versions.
