## üì• Installation Guide

### üîå Recommended Method (SSH Connection)
```bash
wget -O /usr/bin/install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale/main/install_en.sh && chmod +x /usr/bin/install.sh && /usr/bin/install.sh
```

### üì¶ Install Uncompressed Version (Approx. 25MB)
Use the `--notiny` parameter:
```bash
wget -O /usr/bin/install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale/main/install_en.sh && chmod +x /usr/bin/install.sh && /usr/bin/install.sh --notiny
```

### üëãüèª Manual Persistent Installation
1. Download the `tailscaled` file corresponding to your device architecture from [Releases](https://github.com/GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale/releases).
2. Place the binary executable in your device's `/usr/bin` directory.
3. Rename the binary executable to `tailscaled`.
4. Create a symbolic link using `ln -sv /usr/bin/tailscaled /usr/bin/tailscale`.
5. Download the `tailscale` script from [Code Directory](https://github.com/GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale/tree/main/etc/init.d) (or manually create and copy the contents into a new file).
6. Place this file in your device's `/etc/init.d` directory.
7. Grant execute permissions:`chmod +x /etc/init.d/tailscale && chmod +x /usr/bin/tailscale && chmod +x /usr/bin/tailscaled`
8. Run `/etc/init.d/tailscale start`, wait a moment, then execute `tailscale up`.
9. EnjoyÔΩûü´∞üèª

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

1. **Temporary Installation Warning**  
   üî• The `/tmp` directory is cleared upon reboot! This method is only recommended for devices that cannot persistently install due to storage constraints. Since temporary installation heavily depends on network availability, do not solely rely on Tailscale to avoid interruptions.

2. **Network Requirements**  
   üåê Must have access to GitHub .

3. **Compatibility**  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Most devices or architectures have not been tested. If you encounter issues, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale/issues), and I will work on fixing them as soon as possible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### üõ†Ô∏è Compilation Optimization

Utilizes the `--extra-small` compilation flag from Tailscale's [official documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1207/small-tailscale) along with [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) binary compression technology to shrink Tailscale to **20%** of its original size, making it feasible to use on OpenWrt devices with limited storage. üéâ

### üì¶ Core Script Logic

1. **Persistent Installation**  
   - Places the `tailscaled` binary in `/usr/bin`, creating a symbolic link using `ln -sv tailscaled tailscale`. Only **7MB** of storage is required to run Tailscale. Although the minimum space requirement is **7MB**, we recommend having at least **20MB** for a stable persistent installation.

2. **Temporary Installation**  
   - Places the `tailscaled` binary in `/tmp`, creating a symbolic link as above. Since it is stored in the `/tmp` directory, this method **uses device RAM**. Upon reboot, the script will automatically re-download Tailscale.
